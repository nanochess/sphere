Draws a wireframe sphere using Javascript and creates an animated GIF
by Oscar Toledo G. http://nanochess.org/

I needed an animation of a wireframe sphere rotating and couldn't find a
suitable one online, the online one acceptable requested the payment of
outrageous $49 dollars!!!

So I coded a wireframe sphere and routines to project it onto screen,
also got a GIF encoder from Github and put all together in 1 hour and half.

Enjoy it!
